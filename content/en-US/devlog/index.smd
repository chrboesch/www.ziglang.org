# [2024-09-16]($section.id('2024-09-16'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

I've been porting stb_truetype.h to Zig on the side. Check out this snippet:

```c
{
    float sum = 0;
    for (i=0; i < result->w; ++i) {
      float k;
      int m;
      sum += scanline2[i];
      k = scanline[i] + sum;
      k = (float) STBTT_fabs(k)*255 + 0.5f;
      m = (int) k;
      if (m > 255) m = 255;
      result->pixels[j*result->stride + i] = (unsigned char) m;
    }
}
```
⬇️
```zig
{
    var sum: f32 = 0;
    for (scanline, scanline2, result.pixels[j*result.stride..][0..result.w]) |s, s2, *p| {
        sum += s2;
        p.* = @min(@abs(s + sum)*255 + 0.5, 255);
    }
}
```

Ahh, much better.

# [Zig tokenizer updated to use labeled switch statements]($section.id('2024-09-11'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

Now that Matthew landed [labeled switch continue syntax](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21257), it's time
to start using it.

[Eric Petersen swooped in for a first-time contribution](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21367),
updating Zig's tokenizer to use the new syntax, measuring a 13% wall time
performance increase for the `zig ast-check` command:

This line of code tickles me:

```zig
state: switch (State.start) {
```
